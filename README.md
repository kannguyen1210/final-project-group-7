# final-project-group-7

For our final project, we are looking at police brutality. We are still refining the question we want to ask, but so far we have looked at if the use of body cameras play a significqnt role in preventing police shooting of civilians. We are also looking at a number of other factors like if they were showing signs of mental illness, if they were armed, and if they were trying to flee.
