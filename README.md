# final-project-group-7

For our final project, we are looking at police brutality.
Present-day conflicts of equality vs. equity
We decided to relate the difference between equity and equality using data on police violence against minorities
We will use machine learning to see if it can predict the race of an individual killed by police using multiple variables such as: if armed, fleeing from police, age, 
We want to see if the individuals killed by police were indeed a threat, or were the killings race driven.


Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to split and train our model because it can give us a binary classifier True or False answer.

In the first portion we want to see if the individuals killed by police were indeed a threat, or race driven

In the second portion of the project we want to explore conceptual similarities scores across relevant words we have chosen using Natural Language Processing (NLP), heavily drawing from machine learning and AI models GloVe (GLobal Vectors for Word Representation) and spaCy
