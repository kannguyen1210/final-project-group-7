The dataset takes in the various facotrs: age, gender, signs of mental illness, if the individual tried to flee and if in all of these instances a body camera was worn by a police officer who shot and killed the suspect. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to split and train our model because it can give us a binary classifier True or False answer, if police were or were not wearing a body camera.
