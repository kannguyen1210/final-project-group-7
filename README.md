# final-project-group-7

For our final project, we are looking at police brutality. We are still refining the question we want to ask, but so far we have looked at if the use of body cameras play a significqnt role in preventing police shooting of civilians. We are also looking at a number of other factors like if they were showing signs of mental illness, if they were armed, and if they were trying to flee. 

The dataset takes in the various facotrs: age, gender, signs of mental illness, if the individual tried to flee and if in all of these instances a body camera was worn by a police officer who shot and killed the suspect. Support Vector Machine (SVM) was used to split and train our model because it can give us a binary classifier True or False answer, if police were or were not wearing a body camera.
